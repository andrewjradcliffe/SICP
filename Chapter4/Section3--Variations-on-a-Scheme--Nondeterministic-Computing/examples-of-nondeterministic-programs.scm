If we consider the restrictions checked prior to rejection, then it does
seem that some orderings would be faster than others, as some requirements
are more easily satisfied than others. Namely, the requirements involving more than
1 entity are likely to have fewer feasible solutions due to simple permutation.
In essence, one can reject a proposed solution by examination of any given
constraint, but it is possible to satisfy certain constraints with greater ease.
To give an example, (> miller cooper) can be unsatisfied while the preceding 4
constraints are satisfied.

(require (> miller cooper))
(require (not (= (abs (- fletcher cooper)) 1)))
(require (not (= (abs (- smith fletcher)) 1)))
(require (not (= cooper 1)))
(require (not (= fletcher 1)))
(require (not (= fletcher 5)))
(require (not (= baker 5)))

However, the re-ordering above still permits proposals which will fail on
single variable requirements. Thus, it will not be faster unless we could proceed
from the partial solutions generated by the multiple versions.

;; Ex. 4.40
#|

Before distinct: 5^5 possible assignments
After distinct:  5! possible assignments

There are several ways to improve. First, we consider the creation of only the permutations.
Then, we consider a second improvement which exploits the structure of the problem.
